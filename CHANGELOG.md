# @hao3039032/pi-plan-vanguard

## 0.63.2 (fork)

### Patch Changes

- **Verified against Pi 1.1.0** (from 1.0.4): the extension API surface is purely additive for this package (`ToolRenderContext`/`ToolExecutionEndEvent` gain optional `durationMs`, the render context gains `outputPad`, and `agent_settled` gains `aborted`; the custom `plan_mode_complete` renderer returns a component and does not use `renderShell: "self"`, so Pi applies the new tool-output padding itself). `tsc --noEmit`, the full test suite, and the runtime build pass with devDependencies moved to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`/`pi-tui` 1.1.0; the two `RunnerEmitEvent` fixtures now include `aborted: false` because the event type made the field required.
- **An aborted settlement never restarts finalization.** `agent_settled` handlers now read Pi 1.1.0's `aborted` flag: when the run was cancelled (for example with Escape), a pending finalization request is dropped instead of auto-sending the retry prompt. This closes the edge case where an abort before any assistant message left the observed run-end outcome "normal" and the extension restarted the agent against the user's intent. On Pi 1.0.x the field is absent and the guard is inert.

## 0.63.1 (fork)

### Patch Changes

- **Verified against Pi 1.0.4** (from 1.0.1): the extension API surface is unchanged for this package (1.0.4 only adds `ToolLoadout.getPromptGuidelines()`), `tsc --noEmit` and the full test suite pass unchanged, and devDependencies move to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`/`pi-tui` 1.0.4.
- **Restored the test infrastructure lost in the fork extraction.** The fork flattened `packages/pi-plan-mode` to the repository root but left the shared monorepo files behind, so 24 of 35 test files could not even load (`../../../test/support.js`, `../../../scripts/runtime-builder.mjs`) and the runtime build script was broken. Vendored from the fork point (f39946a3, unchanged upstream since): `test/base-support.ts` (mock support), `test/runtime-builder-contract.ts` (standalone-root aware), `scripts/runtime-builder.mjs`, plus the vitest setup (`vitest.config.ts` with `pool: "forks"`, per-test `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, and `vi.restoreAllMocks()` after every test — without it, consecutive shortcut fixtures spy recursively and the settings watcher silently dies).
- **Fixed the runtime build contract violation from 0.63.0**: `plan-mode.ts` and `tool-selection.ts` imported `sanitizeTerminalText` from `@narumitw/pi-tui-kit`, which the eager entry graph forbids (`forbiddenEagerExternals`). The sanitizer is vendored as `src/terminal-text.ts` (MIT, identical behavior: ESC/CSI/OSC/DCS/PM/APC sequences, Bidi controls, line separators). The build now passes again.
- **The generated entry now ships `srt-launcher.mjs`**: the 0.63.0 launcher is resolved by file URL relative to the entry, so `dist/` builds could not run the sandbox probe (`Cannot find module '.../dist/srt-launcher.mjs'`). `scripts/build-runtime.mjs` copies the runtime asset next to the published output.
- **Updated the tests that 0.63.0 changed underneath**: srt command wrapping now goes through `node srt-launcher.mjs --srt … --settings … --open-network --scrub-env`, `/plan doctor` reports the open network and credential hardening, the Settings menu has the Delegation and Sandbox rows (15 rows), and `ExtensionRunner.createToolContext` replaces `createContext` at tool-execute call sites (matches upstream). Also fixes `test/issue-1263-repro` (stale `packages/pi-plan-mode` path) and the srt-profile test (read `getAgentDir()` instead of the unset env var). The real-srt regression's 10 s timeout is covered by raising the vendored timeout-policy cap to 10 s.

## 0.63.0 (fork)

### Minor Changes

- **The Plan-mode sandbox network is open by default** for anonymous public-internet access (package registries, documentation, public repositories), following the rule "public network yes, the user's identity no". Plan mode now runs sandboxed commands through `src/srt-launcher.mjs`, which drives srt's library API (`SandboxManager`) — no srt fork: the srt CLI only accepts explicit domain lists, while the library's ask callback approves every hostname. Traffic still crosses srt's proxy inside a separate network namespace, so srt's resolved-address guard keeps loopback, link-local, cloud-metadata, and this host's own addresses blocked, and the profile adds the private and carrier-grade NAT ranges. `planSandbox.network: "allowlist"` restores the previous strict mode (`allowedDomains` only; empty = no network).
- **Credential hardening is on by default** (`planSandbox.credentialHardening`): an extended list of credential stores is unreadable in the sandbox (gh/git credentials, npm/yarn/pip/cargo/gem/composer auth, Docker/Kubernetes, cloud CLIs, password stores and keyrings, Codex/Claude/Copilot logins, browser profiles, and the Pi agent's `auth.json`/`mcp-auth.json`/`models.json`/`mcp.json`), and identity-bearing environment variables (tokens, API keys, secrets, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `KUBECONFIG`, `XAUTHORITY`, …) are removed before each command. Setting it to `false` releases every built-in credential denial and the env scrub (user risk). Unix sockets stay blocked by srt's seccomp filter in every mode.
- The Plan contract tells the model whether the network is open and that it must never authenticate as the user or change remote state; `/plan doctor` reports the network mode and hardening; Settings gains **Sandbox network** (open/allowlist) and **Credential hardening** rows, and the domain list becomes **Allowlist domains**. npm's cache is redirected to the private scratch directory so `npm view`/`npm pack` work in the read-only home.
- Resumed workflows keep their frozen network mode and hardening only when they are no wider than the current settings; sessions persisted before 0.63.0 restore as allowlist + hardened.

## 0.62.2 (fork)

### Patch Changes

- The Plan-prompt delegation line now asks for one `subagent` call per child with only `agent` and `task`, issuing several in the same turn for parallel recon. pi-subagents exposes top-level `tasks`/`chain` only when its `disabledFeatures` includes `workflow-scripts`, so the previous "static `tasks`/`chain` batches" advice led models to improvise blocked shapes (for example `args: {tasks}`) under the default configuration. Docs and the block-reason guidance match.
- The prompt tells the model that subagent results arrive automatically and not to wait for or poll them, since `bg_wait` and run-management actions (`status`, ...) stay blocked in Plan mode.

## 0.62.1 (fork)

### Patch Changes

- Delegation admission now matches the real pi-subagents management API: the read-only agent listing is `action: "list"` (optionally with the boolean `capabilities` modifier and `agentScope: user|project|both`), not the `action: "capabilities"` the 0.61.0 notes named — pi-subagents has no such action, so those calls are now correctly rejected as an unknown management action.
- Verified read-only admission passes the parent session's model (`provider`/`id`) into the pi-subagents preflight contract, so provider-scoped agent settings overrides (`subagents.agentOverridesByProvider`) apply exactly as they do at execution, and verdicts cache per provider/id.
- Verified read-only admission rejects agents whose preflight contract resolves a default output path (`roots.outputPath`): admission preflights carry no per-call output, so that path is an agent default or a settings override, and with `artifacts: false` a relative default lands inside the repository working tree. Definition-file guards also reject empty and block-scalar (`>`/`|`) `output` values.
- Starting a Plan workflow awaits the plan-scout registration before creating the sandbox and publishing the Plan contract, so a `/plan <prompt>` start can no longer freeze the prompt without the delegation line even though registration succeeds immediately after.
- The Plan-prompt delegation line now says "static `tasks`/`chain` batches" (chain batches were always admitted).
- Settings live reload reacts to the legacy `pi-plan-mode.json`/`plan-mode.json` filenames again, not just the canonical `pi-plan-vanguard.json`, when no explicit settings path is configured.
- `/plan doctor` says "planAdmittedAgents only" when plan-scout itself is not registered and the preflight is unavailable; the Settings delegation placeholder no longer suggests an entry for plan-scout (it needs none).
- README: the Security Delegation bullet no longer reads as if the host-side parameters were the safe ones, and the Install section notes that optional plan-scout delegation needs `pi install npm:pi-subagents`.

## 0.62.0 (fork)

### Minor Changes

- Renamed the package to `@hao3039032/pi-plan-vanguard` and the repository to [hao3039032/pi-plan-vanguard](https://github.com/hao3039032/pi-plan-vanguard): this extension now evolves independently of upstream `@narumitw/pi-plan-mode`, which remains credited for the original design (see the README provenance note). The `/plan` commands, helper tool names, and the `plan-scout` agent name are unchanged. The old repository URL redirects after the rename, but reinstall from the new URL (`pi install git:github.com/hao3039032/pi-plan-vanguard`) so future updates resolve cleanly.
- Settings migrate to `<agent dir>/pi-plan-vanguard.json`. The former filenames `pi-plan-mode.json` and `plan-mode.json` remain readable legacy files (newest wins), are never modified, and the first explicit Settings save writes the new canonical file from the complete legacy document — including unknown fields. All settings filenames, current and legacy, stay write-denied inside the srt sandbox and protected from Plan-mode writes. Internal srt profile/scratch file patterns keep their previous names so cleanup of files from older versions still works.

## 0.61.0 (fork)

### Minor Changes

- Ship `plan-scout`, a read-only reconnaissance subagent registered through pi-subagents at session start (tools `read`/`grep`/`find`/`ls`, replace-mode system prompt with a file:line evidence discipline, thinking `low`, no default output path). A preflight resolve of the name blocks registration when a configured agent already uses it — pi-subagents throws on every agent discovery otherwise — and `/plan doctor` reports the collision instead.
- Auto-admit read-only `subagent` calls per call during Plan mode (never persisted into the workflow allowlist): `action: "capabilities"` listings, single-child `{agent, task}` calls, static `tasks` batches, and `chain` steps (`{agent, task, as?}` or `{parallel}`), under a strict parameter whitelist. Host-side parameters — `gate`, `acceptance` (other than `false`), `share`, `worktree`, `isolation`, `sessionDir`, `machine`, `cwd`, `fast`, `outputSchema`, `outputMode`, `agentContract`, `extensionBindings`, and any output path — deny the exemption because they execute in the Pi host process, not in the read-only child.
- Every referenced agent must pass one of three admission paths: the registered `plan-scout`, the new `planAdmittedAgents` setting (trusted names; the parameter whitelist still applies), or verified read-only admission through the pi-subagents preflight contract — an explicit, entirely read-only tool allowlist (readers, `contact_supervisor`/`intercom`/`structured_output`, and parent tools annotated `readOnlyHint` without `destructiveHint`), no configured child extensions or tool extension paths, and a definition file free of `runner`/`machine`/`defaultAcceptance`/`acceptance`/`extensions`/`subagentOnlyExtensions` directives and absolute/`..` `output` paths.
- `workflow: true` script delegation is admitted only with the new `planAdmitWorkflowScripts` setting (default off): a script can spawn arbitrary agents and carry host-side `runs.run` options, so admission is a full trust decision.
- The Plan mode contract adds a Phase 1 delegation line while plan-scout is registered; `/plan doctor` reports the scout status, the verification mode (verified via preflight vs degraded to plan-scout + planAdmittedAgents), and the script admission state.
- Declare the optional `pi-subagents` peer dependency; without it, delegation admission degrades gracefully and everything else keeps working.

## 0.60.0 (fork)

### Minor Changes

- Understand Pi 1.0 tool exposure: native MCP and built-in extension tools (source `builtin:mcp` and friends) now take the annotation path instead of being blocked as unknown built-ins, so a declared `readOnlyHint` auto-admits them and everything else becomes explicit opt-in; tools without policy metadata (`sourceInfo.source`) fail closed as blocked.
- Route tool-call checks by call origin: nested calls (with `parentToolCallId`) follow nested semantics, so registered codemode/deferred tools run through other tools without activation while model-only tools can never be called by other tools; direct and model-only tools still require activation. Codemode/deferred tools can also be selected up front (`filterAvailableSelectedToolNames`) and stay in the frozen policy, so nested calls admit them mid-workflow.
- Unify tool presentation across the launch menu and Settings with `planModeToolSelection` (labels like `X — inactive in Pi` / `X — blocked by Plan policy`, exposure notes "callable via other tools" / "model calls only"), sanitize untrusted MCP/extension names and descriptions in both menus with the kit's `sanitizeTerminalText` (bidi/OSC-aware), and give inactive `grep`/`find`/`ls` actionable guidance (`defaultTools` full-list instructions without paths or modifier examples).
- Update the Plan mode-contract wording for exposure semantics ("extension/MCP tools", nested-call checking); existing sessions keep resolving through the `details.mode`/marker fallback.
- Docs: new "Enable inactive built-in search tools" section with `defaultTools` JSON examples (full list and Pi 0.99+ `+grep`-style modifiers), MCP opt-in notes, and exposure notes in the tools workflows.

## 0.59.2 (fork)

### Patch Changes

- Remove the `update_plan` session-tracker carve-out: pi has no such built-in tool, so it is classified as an unknown built-in and stays blocked like any other unrecognized built-in name. The plan contract no longer mentions it.

## 0.59.1 (fork)

### Minor Changes

- Admit every harmless tool automatically during Plan mode: sandboxed `bash`, built-in readers, and extension/MCP tools whose `readOnlyHint` annotation marks them non-mutating (`update_plan` does not exist in pi and stays classified as an unknown blocked built-in). Explicit selection is now only required for tools that can mutate or reach unknown systems. Harmless tools are also admitted on first use when activated mid-workflow, with or without an explicit selection list. The bash/wrap, write/edit (plans-dir-only) and PowerShell blocks are unchanged.

## 0.59.0 (fork)

### Patch Changes

- Fix a sandbox escape: srt profiles were stored in the OS temp dir while `/tmp` was sandbox-writable, so a sandboxed command could rewrite its own profile (srt re-reads it on every call) and widen later calls. Profiles now live in `<agent dir>/srt` (0700 directory, 0600 files), the profile directory and pi-plan-mode settings files are always in the profile's `denyWrite` (which wins over any `allowWrite`), and the blanket `/tmp` write grant is replaced by a private per-workflow scratch directory handed to commands as `TMPDIR` (via srt's `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR`) and removed when the workflow ends. Writes are allowed only in the plan output directory plus that scratch `TMPDIR`.
- The sandbox setup guide detects the Linux package manager on `PATH` (pacman, apt-get, dnf, zypper) and emits matching install commands (e.g. `sudo pacman -S --needed bubblewrap socat ripgrep` on Arch); without a detected manager it lists the package names generically.
- Allow the built-in `write`/`edit` tools during Plan mode for active tools whose target resolves (after `..` normalization and symlink resolution) inside the plan output directory; every other target, extension overrides of those names, and `update_plan` stay blocked.
- Plan start (and a restored workflow's re-probe) creates a missing plan output directory so sandboxed commands can write drafts from the first call.
- The `plan_mode_complete` result ends with a `📄 <path>` footer for the persisted document (the stored plan is unchanged), and the ready-plan menu lists the document path.
- Fix plan-document and output-directory escapes: plan documents are written through a temp file renamed into the verified output directory (planted symlinks and hard links are replaced, never followed, and abandoned for a fresh filename); a relative `planOutputDir` that is or passes through a symlink, or resolves outside the working directory, makes Plan start fail closed; the resolved real directory and `planSandbox` extras are frozen per workflow (settings changes apply to the next workflow, and restored session data never widens the sandbox); the whole pi agent directory is write-denied in the profile and refused for `write`/`edit`.
- Harden sandbox lifecycle: restored-workflow re-probes never reject unhandled and, when the sandbox is lost during a run, leave Plan mode after the run settles; concurrent Plan starts are refused while one is probing; stale probes and dropped sandboxes remove their files; only profile/scratch paths this extension creates are ever deleted.
- Plan draft annotations no longer depend on the command text: a successful admitted `write`/`edit` of a Markdown file reports its target, and after every Plan-mode `bash` call the newest top-level Markdown file modified in the plan output directory since the call started is reported, as `📄 Plan draft updated → <path>`. The legacy `<proposed_plan>` echo also ends with the `📄 <path>` footer.

### Minor Changes

- Replace the reviewed bash/PowerShell command allowlists with the **Anthropic Sandbox Runtime (srt)**: every Plan-mode `bash` call is wrapped as `srt -s <profile> -c '<command>'` and runs inside an OS-level sandbox (Seatbelt/bubblewrap/srt-win) with writes limited to the plan output directory and a private scratch `TMPDIR`, secret-path read denials, and a deny-by-default network allowlist. There is no allowlist fallback: when the sandbox is unavailable, `/plan start` fails closed and injects an agent setup guide with exact install commands; `/plan <prompt>` stashes the prompt for the recovered start. Resumed workflows re-probe and leave Plan mode when the sandbox is gone.
- Persist completed plans as Markdown under a plan output directory (default `plans/`, `planOutputDir` setting): accepted plans are written as `plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`, revisions overwrite the same file, and the TUI renders the finished plan with a path footer. The agent may draft in the sandbox-writable directory; draft updates echo on the bash tool result, and `/plan show` renders the newest draft when no finished plan exists.
- Add `/plan doctor` for a human-readable sandbox and profile diagnosis, `planSandbox` settings (`allowWrite`, `denyRead`, `allowedDomains`), and the `PI_PLAN_MODE_SRT_PATH` override. Block `powershell` during Plan mode (v1 sandboxes `bash` only). Statusline shows `plan active (srt)`.

### Breaking Changes

- Remove the reviewed bash/PowerShell allowlists and the `safeSubcommands` setting; srt becomes a hard Plan-mode dependency (`npm i -g @anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` plus bubblewrap/socat/ripgrep on Linux, ripgrep on macOS).
